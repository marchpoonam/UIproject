Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are
low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.[18] They supply dietary fiber
and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables
are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of
cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.[19][20][21]
Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three
servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those who eat more than five servings
have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart
disease or stroke.[22] The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably;
some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little
fat,[23] and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and
vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.

The consumption of crunchy and hard-to-chew foods, such as raw
vegetables, during youth, while the bones are still growing, is needed for the
human's, and other animals', jaws' proper development, and without their
consumption, the jaws do not grow to their full size, thus not leaving enough
room for the teeth to grow in correctly, causing crooked and impacted
teeth.[24][25]
