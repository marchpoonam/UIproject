<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such asand directly introduce content into the page.

Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
